This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when passing an array of strings to a function that expects a single string. The function greeter takes a string as input and returns a greeting. However, when an array of strings is passed as an argument, a type error occurs. The solution involves either modifying the function signature to accept an array of strings or modifying the function call to pass a single string.
